# How to Speak

### [H﻿ow to Speak, MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&list=WL&index=7&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare)



## How to Start a Talk

1. Never start with a joke, it always falls flat.
2. Start with an empowerment statement, i.e. what will the audience achieve after the talk.
3. Humans have only one language processor, so make sure they focus on what you're saying.

### Sample Heuristics:

1. Cycle on the topic. Repeat what you are talking about to reinforce it.
2. Build a fence around your ideas, so audiences don't confuse them with others. Tell them how your idea is different.
3. Use verbal punctuation to help audiences re-focus. State what you’ve covered and what’s to come.
4. Ask moderately difficult questions every now and then. Avoid overly difficult ones.

### The Tools

#### Time & Place:

1. Choose an appropriate time. 11 AM is good for the first lecture.
2. The place should be well lit.
3. Know the place beforehand and be prepared to address challenges.
4. Make sure it's reasonably populated.

#### Boards & Props:

1. Chalks and boards are good for informing and teaching.
2. Boards offer a well-paced medium for absorbing content.
3. Use boards and props for empathetic mirroring—audiences feel like they’re doing the writing.
4. Use your hands to draw attention.
5. Slides are good for exposing ideas.
6. Don’t use laser pointers; opt for a sign-post to stay engaged with the audience.
7. Slides should have minimal words. You explain them.
8. Ensure font size is large enough for easy reading.
9. Props help visualize concepts.
10. Practice with people unfamiliar with your work to ensure clarity.

### Inspire

1. Show your passion for the subject.
2. Promise a solution to a problem.
3. Inspire by igniting passion.
4. Teach people how to think by:

   * Providing stories they need to know
   * Asking questions they should ask about these stories
   * Sharing mechanisms to analyze stories
   * Offering ways to connect stories
   * Demonstrating how to evaluate the reliability of stories

### Persuade

#### Job Talks:

* **Vision** – Present a relatable problem and your approach.
* **Achievement** – Outline the steps you'll take to solve it.

#### Getting Famous:

* **Why?** – You want your work recognized.
* **How?** – Brand it. Use a slogan, a salient idea, and a compelling story.

### How to End a Talk

1. **The last slide:** Summarize what the audience has learned or achieved. Let them read it.
2. **Final words:**

   * Never thank the audience.
   * End with a call to action.
   * Alright, you can tell a joke now—they’ll feel they had fun all along.
