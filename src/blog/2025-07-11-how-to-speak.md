<h2>How to Start a Talk</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Never start with a joke, it always falls flat.</li>
  <li>Start with an empowerment statement, i.e. what will the audience achieve after the talk.</li>
  <li>Humans have only one language processor, so make sure they focus on what you're saying.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Sample Heuristics:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Cycle on the topic. Repeat what you are talking about to reinforce it.</li>
  <li>Build a fence around your ideas, so audiences don't confuse them with others. Tell them how your idea is different.</li>
  <li>Use verbal punctuation to help audiences re-focus. State what you’ve covered and what’s to come.</li>
  <li>Ask moderately difficult questions every now and then. Avoid overly difficult ones.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Tools</h3>

<h4>Time & Place:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Choose an appropriate time. 11 AM is good for the first lecture.</li>
  <li>The place should be well lit.</li>
  <li>Know the place beforehand and be prepared to address challenges.</li>
  <li>Make sure it's reasonably populated.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Boards & Props:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Chalks and boards are good for informing and teaching.</li>
  <li>Boards offer a well-paced medium for absorbing content.</li>
  <li>Use boards and props for empathetic mirroring—audiences feel like they’re doing the writing.</li>
  <li>Use your hands to draw attention.</li>
  <li>Slides are good for exposing ideas.</li>
  <li>Don’t use laser pointers; opt for a sign-post to stay engaged with the audience.</li>
  <li>Slides should have minimal words. You explain them.</li>
  <li>Ensure font size is large enough for easy reading.</li>
  <li>Props help visualize concepts.</li>
  <li>Practice with people unfamiliar with your work to ensure clarity.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Inspire</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Show your passion for the subject.</li>
  <li>Promise a solution to a problem.</li>
  <li>Inspire by igniting passion.</li>
  <li>Teach people how to think by:
    <ul>
      <li>Providing stories they need to know</li>
      <li>Asking questions they should ask about these stories</li>
      <li>Sharing mechanisms to analyze stories</li>
      <li>Offering ways to connect stories</li>
      <li>Demonstrating how to evaluate the reliability of stories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Persuade</h3>

<h4>Job Talks:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vision</strong> – Present a relatable problem and your approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Achievement</strong> – Outline the steps you'll take to solve it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting Famous:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Why?</strong> – You want your work recognized.</li>
  <li><strong>How?</strong> – Brand it. Use a slogan, a salient idea, and a compelling story.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>How to End a Talk</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The last slide:</strong> Summarize what the audience has learned or achieved. Let them read it.</li>
  <li><strong>Final words:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Never thank the audience.</li>
      <li>End with a call to action.</li>
      <li>Alright, you can tell a joke now—they’ll feel they had fun all along.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
