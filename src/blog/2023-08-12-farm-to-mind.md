Prabhakar Prasad grew up in a small town in Bihar, India and moved to the USA in 2011.

He has a bachelor's degree in computer science. As well as a master's degree in business administration. He is fortunate to have successful careers. His roles include: software engineer, model, project manager, sales director, and an actor.

Yet, A heart attack and heart break deteriorated both his physical and mental health.

He turned to an ancient book from India known as the *Bhagavad Gita.* The scripture provided an answer to his deteriorating health. The root of all our problems is the mind and you are neither the body nor the mind. You suffer because you are with the mind.

Desperate to separate himself from the mind he started seeking a teacher. He needed someone to teach him meditation practice: Dhyana. The saying “The teacher appears when the student is ready,” is true for Prabhakar. He met Balmiki who introduced him to the teachings of Maharshi Mehi.

Prabhakar continues to learn and practice. He invites others into this beautiful journey called: *[Journey to the Self](https://journeytotheself.org/)*

He currently lives in the mountains of Topanga, Los Angeles. He loves cooking, learning Indian classical music from Balmiki, writing, and filming sketches.
