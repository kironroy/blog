# Marty Lobdell’s Lecture: Study Less Study Smart

## 🗝️ Key Insights

Marty Lobdell shared two insightful quotes:

"If it doesn’t change your behavior, you haven’t learned it."

and

"Teachers want students to achieve. It drives them."

Engaging in twenty-five minutes of focused study followed by a five-minute interval for relaxation can enhance your learning efficiency.

It's essential to establish a specialized study space that includes a desk and adequate lighting. Refrain from using the bedroom or kitchen/dining areas for studying, since they are primarily intended for rest, meal preparation, and dining.

Grasping the distinction between facts and concepts is essential. Facts are fixed data requiring memorization. Concepts are more expansive and meaningful.

Distinguishing recognition from recollection is vital too. For example, recognizing an old magazine differs from recalling its content sequence and ads. Recollection entails retaining both the information and the comprehensive understanding of a topic.

## 📚 Textbooks and SQ3R

Textbooks are powerful tools, but students need to learn how to use them. One such approach is SQ3R. SQ3R stands for: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review.

To use SQ3R:

**Survey:** Before diving into the reading, take a moment to scan the pages. Pay attention to photos, **bold** or *italic* text, quiz questions, and text queries.

**Question:** If there are quiz questions provided, review them first. This will help you focus on key points. If not, take note of any **bold** text or images and ask yourself why they might be significant in the context of the textbook.

**Read:** Finally, read the chapter thoroughly. This will allow you to make connections and find deeper meaning within the subject matter. Discuss the "bigger picture" and the concepts you've learned. Share your knowledge with someone or even an empty chair. After all, we are storytellers.

**Review:** Always revisit your work, especially before a test. If the teacher highlights something in class, make necessary adjustments. Connect this with what you've read in the textbook and noted during lectures. Avoid surprises by asking your instructor for help and attending office hours. Remember, "Teachers are driven by their students' success."

## 🧪 Test Preparation

When preparing for a test, we all have the same amount of time. How you use it is what matters. It's about balancing opportunity cost and value. If you're involved in one activity, you can't participate in another. So, understand what's valuable.

Start studying for a test right from the beginning of the quarter or semester using effective techniques. Ensure you get enough sleep and avoid cramming the night before the test!
