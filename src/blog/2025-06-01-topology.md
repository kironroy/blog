One of the five films made by Charles and Ray Eames for the "Mathematica Peep Shows", which was played at the opening of IBM's Mathematica Exhibit in 1961. Topology explores Jordan's Curve Theorem. The fact that a simple closed curve divides a plane into an inside and an outside is introduced as a concept in topology.
